## System Integration Testing
- Done after System Testing

<a id=2> </a>

## Structured-Based Test Design
- Applicable Cases:
    - The business process flow for mortgage approval
    - Control flow of the program to calculate repayments

- Non-Applicable Cases:
    - Boundaries between mortgage interest rate bands
    - An invalid transition between two different arrear statuses

## SDLC Model
- Characteristics of Good Testing
    - Having a corresponding testing activity for each development activity
    - Testers should be involved in reviewing documents as soon as drafts are available
    - Each test level has test objectives specific to that level

- **NOT** characteristics of Good Testing
    - Providing complete test coverage of all branches of the system code
    - Acceptance testing is always the final test level to be applied
    - All test levels are planned and completed for each developed feature
    - Testers are involved as soon as the first piece of code can be executed

## Beta Testing
- Testing performed by potential customers at their own locations

<a id=5></a>

## Tests at different Test Level
- **CAN** be performed at all test levels:
    - Structural Testing (White-Box)

- **CAN NOT** be performed at all test levels:
    - System Testing
    - Operational Testing
    - Integration Testing

<a id=6></a>

## White Box Testing
- Referred to as:
    - Glass Box
    - Clear Box
    - Transparent Box
    - Structural Testing

- Techniques:
    - Structural Testing

<a id=7></a>

## Three-Dimensional Testing
- **Time**
- **Organizational**
- **Cultural**

<a id=8></a>

## Component Testing
- **Consists of**:
    - Development team performs test
    - Also known as isolation or module testing
    - Should have completion criteria planned
    - Regression testing

<a id=9></a>

## Functional Testing
- Software Models that can be used
    - Process Flow Model
    - State Transition Model
    - Plain Language Specification Model

- Software Models that **CANNOT** be used
    - Menu Structure Model

- Useful throughout the life cycle and can be applied by:
    - Business Analysts
    - Testers
    - Developers
    - Users

- **NOT** more powerful than static testing
- **NOT** less important than static testing
- **DOES NOT** include Inspection

## Differences between Contractors
- Cultural Differences

<a id=11></a>

## Alpha Testing
- Performed at the developing organization's site

<a id=12></a>

## V-Model
- Test levels
    - System Testing
    - System Integration Testing

<a id=13></a>

## Maintenance Testing
- Scope:
    - Risk
    - Size of the Changes
    - Size of the System under Test

<a id=14></a>

## Component Integration testing
- Done after Component Testing

<a id=15></a>

## Test Level
- Group of test activities that are organized and managed together

<a id=16></a>

## User Acceptance Testing
- The entire system is tested to verify that all functional information structural and quality requirements have been met
- A predetermined combination of tests is designed that when executed successfully satisfy management that the system meets specifications
