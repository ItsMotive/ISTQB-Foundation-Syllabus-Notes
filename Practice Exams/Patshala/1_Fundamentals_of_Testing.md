## Fundamental Test Process
- Sequential Steps:

    - **Test Planning and Control**

    - **Test Analysis and Design**
        - Review Test Basis

    - **Test Implementation and Execution**
        - Reporting discrepancies as incidents

    - **Evaluating exit criteria and reporting**

    - **Test Closure activities**

## When to Stop Testing
- Common Factors
    - Deadlines
    - Test budget
    - Percentage of test cases passed
    - Extent of functionality or requirements covered
    - Minimum accepted bug rate
    - Duration of beta or alpha testing periods
- Things to take into account
    - Technical Risk
    - Business Risk
    - Project Constraints

<a id=3></a>

## Exit Criteria
- Purpose
    - Define when to stop testing
    - End of test level
    - When a set of tests has achieved a specific condition

## Defect Removal
- Often **cheaper** to remove defects detected early

<a id=5></a>

## Testing Statements
- Software testing may be required to meet legal or contractual requirements
- Rigorous testing and fixing of defects found can help reduce the risk of problems occurring in an operational environment
- If you find a lot of bugs in testing, you should not be very confident about the quality of software
- Software testing is **NOT** mainly needed to improve the quality of the developer's work
- Rigorous testing is **NOT** used to prove that all failures have been found
- The fewer bugs you find **DOES NOT** correlate to better testing
- The more tests you run **DOES NOT** mean more bugs will be found

## Testing Principle
- Main 7 Principles:
    - **Testing shows the presence of defects**

    - **Exhaustive testing is impossible**
        - Normally impossible to test all the input and output combinations

    - **Early testing**

    - **Defect clustering**

    - **Pesticide paradox**

    - **Testing is context dependent**

    - **Absence of errors fallacy**

## Test Independence
- Benefits
    - Avoids author bias in defining effective tests

<a id=8></a>

## Test Objectives
- Parts of Test Objectives
    - Finding defects
    - Gaining confidence about the level of quality and providing information
    - Preventing defects

- **NOT** Part of Test Objectives
    - Debugging Defects (Software Developers)

## Testing Documents
- **Test Case Specification**
    - Specifies a set of Test Cases for a Test Item
        - Objective
        - Inputs
        - Test Actions
        - Expected results
        - Execution preconditions

- **Test Procedure Specification**
    - Specifies a sequence of actions for the execution of a test also known as test script or manual test script

- **Test Design Specification**
    - Specifies:
        - Test Conditions (Coverage Items) for a Test Item
        - Detailed Test Approach
        - Associated High-Level cases

- **Test Plan**
    - Record of the Test Planning Process
    - Specifies:
        - Scope
        - Approach
        - Resource 
        - Schedule of intended test activities
    - Identifies:
        - Test Items
        - Features to be tested
        - Test tasks
        - Task assignment
        - Degree of tester independence
        - Test Environment
        - Test Design Techniques
        - Entry/Exit Criteria
        - Risks
