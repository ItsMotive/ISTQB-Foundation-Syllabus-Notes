# Chapter 5: Managing the Test Activities

## Description

- It is estimated that you should take around 335 minutes (5 Hours and 35 minutes) to learn.
- In this chapter you will learn:
  - How to plan tests in general
  - How to estimate test effort
  - How risks can influence the scope of testing
  - How to monitor and control test activities
  - How configuration management supports testing
  - How to report defects in a clear and understandable way

- Knowledge Levels
  - K1: Remember - You should remember/recognize a term or a concept
  - K2: Understand - You should be able to select an explanation for a statement related to the question topic
  - K3: Apply - You should select the correct application of a concept or technique and apply it to a given context.
