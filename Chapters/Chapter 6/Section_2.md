## (6.2) Benefits and Risks of Test Automation
- Acquiring a tool does not guarantee success
- Each new tool will require effort to achieve real and lasting benefits
    - Tool introduction
    - Tool maintenance 
    - Tool training
- Some risks need analysis and mitigation
- Test Automation Benefits:
    - Time saved by reducing repetitive manual work
        - Execute regression tests
        - Re-enter the same test data
        - Compare expected vs actual results
        - Check against coding standards
    - Prevention of simple human errors through greater consistency and repeatability
        - Tests are consistently derived from requirements
        - Test data is created in a systematic manner
        - Tests are executed by a tool in the same order with the same frequency 
    - More objective assessment (coverage) and providing measure that are too complicated for humans to derive
    - Easier access to information about testing to support test management and test reporting
        - Statistics
        - Graphs
        - Aggregated data about test progress
        - Defect rates
        - Test execution duration
    - Reduced test execution times to provide earlier defect detection, faster feedback, and faster time to market
    - More time for testers to design new, deeper, and more effective tests

- Test Automation Risks:
    - Unrealistic expectations about the benefits of a tool
        - Functionality
        - Ease of use
    - Inaccurate estimations of time, costs, effort required to introduce a tool, maintain test scripts, and change the existing manual test process
    - Using a test tool when manual testing is more appropriate
    - Relying on a tool too much
        - Ignoring the need of human critical thinking
    - The dependency on the tool vendor which may go out of business, retire the tool, sell the tool to a fix different vendor or provide poor support
        - Responses to queries
        - Upgrades
        - Defect fixes
    - Using an open-source software which may be abandoned, meaning that no further updates are available, or its internal components may require quite frequent updates as a further development
    - The automation tool is not compatible with the development platform
    - Choosing an unsuitable tool that did not comply with he regulatory requirements and/or safety standards
