## (1.5) Essential Skills and Good Practices in Testing

- Good Testers should:

  - Have essential skills to do the job
  - Effective team players
  - Perform testing on different levels of Test Independence

  ## (1.5.1) Generic Skills Required for Testing

  - Testers will often be the bearer of bad news. Therefore communication is a crucial skill.

  - **Testing Knowledge**

    - Increases effectiveness of testing by using Test Techniques

  - **Thoroughness, Carefulness, Curiosity, Attention to Detail, being Methodical**

    - Helps to identify defects, especially hard to find ones.

  - **Good Communication Skills, Active Listening, Being a Team Player**

    - Helps to interact effectively with Stakeholders
    - Helps to convey information to others
    - Helps to report and discuss defects

  - **Analytical Thinking, Critical Thinking, Creativity**

    - Increases effectiveness of testing

  - **Technical Knowledge**

    - Increases effectiveness of testing by using appropriate Test Tools

  - **Domain Knowledge**
    - Helps to understand and communicate with end users/business representatives

  ## (1.5.2) Whole Team Approach

  - Dependent on Context, Whole Team Approach is not always appropriate.
    - EX: Safety Critical, a high level of test independence may be needed.
  - Any team member with the necessary knowledge or skills can perform any task.
  - Whole team is responsible for Quality.
  - Benefits:
    - Improves team dynamics
    - Enhances communication and collaboration
    - Creates synergy

  ## (1.5.3) Independence of Testing

  - Usually best to carry out testing with multiple levels of Independence

    - Developers performing Component and Component Integration Testing
    - Test Team performing System and System Integration Testing
    - Business Representatives performing Acceptance Testing

  - Work Products Tested by:

    - Original Author (**No Independence**)
    - Author's peers from the same team (**Some Independence**)
    - Testers outside of Author's team, but within organization (**High Independence**)
    - Testers outside of the organization (**Very High Independence**)

  - Drawbacks of Independent Testers:
    - Lack of collaboration
    - Communication Problems
    - Adversarial relationship with Development Team
    - Developers losing sense of Responsibility of Quality
    - Testers being considered as bottlenecks
    - Testers being blamed for delays in release
  - Benefits of Independent Testers:
    - Testers are more likely to find different kinds of failures/defects
      - Due to different backgrounds, technical perspectives, and biases
    - Testers can verify, challenge, or disprove assumptions
