## (1.2) Why is Testing necessary?

- Testing components, systems, and associated documentation helps to identify defects in software.
- Testing's contribution to success should not be restricted to the test team's activities.

- **Testing:**

  - Helps achieve agreed upon goals within:
    - Set Scope
    - Time
    - Quality
    - Budget Constraint

  ## (1.2.1) Testing's Contributions to Success

  - Testing indirectly contributes to high quality test objects.
  - Test objects contribute to decisions to move to next stages of SDLC, such as release decision.

  - **Testing Provides:**
    - Cost-Effective means of detecting defects
    - Means of directly evaluating the quality of a test object at various stages in the SDLC
    - Users with indirect representation on the development project
    - Means of meeting contractual or legal requirements
    - Means of complying with regulatory standards

  ## (1.2.2) Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)

  - Testing and Quality Assurance are **not the same**.
  - Test results are used by QA and QC.

  - **Quality Control (QC)**

    - **Product-Oriented**
    - **Corrective Approach** that focuses on activities to achieve appropriate levels of quality
    - **Test results** are used to fix defects
    - Forms of QC:
      - Testing
      - Model Checking
      - Proof of Correctness
      - Simulation
      - Prototyping

  - **Quality Assurance (QA)**
    - **Process-Oriented**
    - **Preventive Approach** that focuses on implementation and improvement of processes
    - **Test results** are used to provide feedback on development and test processes
    - If a good process is followed correctly, then a good product will be made
    - Applies to development and testing processes
    - Responsibility of everyone on the project

  ## (1.2.3) Errors, Defects, Failures, and Root Causes

  - **Errors (Mistakes)** produce **Defects (Faults, Bugs)** which results in **Failures**.

  - **Errors**

    - Occur due to:
      - Time Pressure
      - Complexity of work products
      - Processes
      - Infrastructure
      - Interactions
      - Tired or lack of adequate training

  - **Defects**

    - Undetected defects produced in early stages of SDLC, often lead to defects later.
    - Can cause failures:
      - Always
      - Under specific circumstances
      - Never
    - Can be found in documentation:
      - Requirements specification
      - Test Script
      - Source Code
      - Build Files

  - **Failures**

    - **Errors** and **Defects** are not the only cause.
      - EX: Firmware defects

  - **Root Cause**
    - Fundamental reason for a problem or problems.
    - Identified through **Root Cause Analysis**.
