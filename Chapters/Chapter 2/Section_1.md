## (2.1) Testing in the Context of SDLC

- **SDLC Models:**
  - Sequential Development Models
    - Waterfall Model
    - V-Model
  - Iterative Development Models
    - Spiral Model
    - Prototyping
    - Agile
  - Incremental Development Models
    - Unified Process
- Software Development Methods and Agile Practices:

  - Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)
  - Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
  - Domain-Driven Development (DDD)
  - Extreme Programming (XP)
  - Feature-Driven Development (FDD)

  ## (2.1.1) Impact of the SDLC on Testing

  - SDLC choice impacts:

    - Scope and Timing of Test Activities
      - Test Levels
      - Test Types
    - Level of detail of Test Documentation
    - Choice of Test Techniques and Test Approach
    - Extent of Test Automation
    - Role and Responsibilities of a Tester

  - With **Sequential Development Models**:

    - Initial Phase Testers participate in:
      - Requirement Reviews
      - Test Analysis
      - Test Design
    - Later Phases:
      - Executable Code is created
    - Dynamic Testing usually cannot be performed early in SDLC

  - With **Iterative** and **Incremental Development Models**:
    - During each iteration:
      - Deliver a working prototype or product increment
      - Static and Dynamic Testing are performed at all test levels
      - Frequent delivery of increments require fast feedback and extensive Regression Testing

  Within **Agile**:
